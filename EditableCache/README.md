# Editable cache

The editable cache allows you to record requests content locally and to modify it with you favorite code editor. Once the request has been saved locally, it will be used instead of the server response.

This script is very useful to test API changes.

## How to use script
Start mitmproxy using the following command :
```
mitmproxy -s editable-cache.py
```
